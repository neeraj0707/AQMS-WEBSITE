        <h3>What is air pollution?</h3>

      <p>
        The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies air pollution as the
        single largest environmental health threat, linked to 7 million
        premature deaths annually. Over 90% of the global population breathes
        air exceeding WHO safety limits for fine particulate matter (PM2.5),
        with the worst impacts felt in low-income cities. Key risks include
        stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infections, while
        children face lifelong developmental harm. WHO’s 2021 guidelines
        tightened safe limits to just 5 µg/m³ annual PM2.5 exposure – a
        benchmark most nations fail to meet. Urgent action on clean energy,
        transport, and industrial policies is needed to prevent what WHO calls a
        "silent public health emergency."
      </p>

      <div class="air_pollution_types">
        <h3>Types of Air Pollutants</h3>
        <p>There are two types of air pollutants:</p>

        <h4>Primary Pollutants</h4>
        <p>
          The pollutants that directly cause air pollution are known as primary
          pollutants. Sulphur-dioxide emitted from factories is a primary
          pollutant.
        </p>

        <h4>Secondary Pollutants</h4>
        <p>
          The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary
          pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the
          intermingling of smoke and fog, is a secondary pollutant.
        </p>

        <h3>Causes of Air Pollution</h3>
        <p>Following are the important causes of air pollution:</p>

        <h4>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h4>
        <p>
          The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur
          dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil
          fuels also results in air pollution.
        </p>

        <h4>Automobiles</h4>
        <p>
          The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses,
          etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of
          greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.
        </p>

        <h4>Agricultural Activities</h4>
        <p>
          Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural
          activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful
          chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it./p>
        </p>

        <h4>Factories and Industries</h4>
        <p>
          Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide,
          organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into
          the air, degrading its quality.
        </p>

        <div class="air_pollution_effects">
          <h3>What are the effects of air pollution on health?</h3>
          <p>
            Air pollution severely impacts human health, causing respiratory
            diseases, heart conditions, and 7 million premature deaths annually
            (WHO). Children exposed to pollutants face developmental issues,
            while pregnant women risk complications like preterm birth.
            Long-term exposure leads to chronic illnesses, including lung cancer
            and diabetes, with vulnerable groups most affected. 
          </p>
          <p>
            While masks and
            air purifiers offer some protection, systemic changes like clean
            energy adoption are essential.
            Addressing this crisis requires urgent global action to reduce
            emissions and safeguard public health.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="air_pollution_preventation">
            <h4>How to protect yourself from air pollution?</h4>
            <p>To protect yourself from air pollution, check daily AQI levels and limit outdoor activities when air quality is poor. Wear N95 masks outside on high-pollution days, and use air purifiers with HEPA filters indoors. Keep windows closed when pollution is severe, and avoid smoking or burning candles. Stay hydrated, eat antioxidant-rich foods, and support clean energy policies for long-term protection.</p>
