        Let’s face it: air pollution is no longer just a problem—it’s a crisis.
        It’s in the news, on our minds, and unfortunately, in our lungs. In
        cities like Delhi, where the Air Quality Index (AQI) recently hit a
        staggering 488—classified as "severe plus"—it feels almost impossible to
        escape the toxic smog. But while you can’t eliminate pollution
        overnight, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in practical,
        easy ways. Here’s how. What Is Air Pollution and What Are Its Effects?
        Air pollution is more than just an environmental issue—it’s a health
        crisis with devastating consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not merely about a hazy skyline or the occasional inconvenience of
        wearing a mask; pollution directly impacts our bodies in ways we’re only
        beginning to fully understand. Let’s start with the basics. Air
        pollution is a mix of harmful substances like particulate matter (PM),
        nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic
        compounds. Among these, PM 2.5 is the most concerning. These microscopic
        particles are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair, meaning
        they can easily penetrate your lungs, enter your bloodstream, and wreak
        havoc on your body. In India, the problem is especially severe. The air
        quality in major cities like Delhi often reaches hazardous levels. On
        November 19, 2024, Delhi’s AQI hit 488, classified as "severe plus,"
        making it the worst in the country. On such days, simply breathing the
        air is equivalent to smoking dozens of cigarettes, a sobering thought
        for anyone living in these conditions. But the danger doesn’t stop
        there. Studies show that India’s current air quality standards are not
        stringent enough to prevent harm. For instance, a staggering 33,000
        deaths occur annually in just 10 Indian cities due to exposure to PM 2.5
        at levels still considered "safe" under Indian guidelines. These deaths
        account for 7.2% of all fatalities in these regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines for PM 2.5 are far
        stricter, highlighting the urgent need to reassess what we define as
        “acceptable” air quality. The impacts of air pollution go beyond the
        lungs. Research in India has linked long-term exposure to polluted air
        with a variety of chronic conditions. For instance, air pollution has
        been shown to exacerbate anaemia by reducing oxygen delivery in the
        blood. It also takes a toll on mental health, contributing to higher
        rates of anxiety and depression. Studies even suggest links to
        neurodegenerative diseases, reduced cognitive function, and
        developmental delays in children.

        <h4>Tips to Stay Safe During High Pollution Levels</h4>
        <p>
          Air Quality Index (AQI) measures the level of air pollution and its
          potential health effects. When AQI levels are high, taking preventive
          measures can help reduce health risks. Here are some key precautions
          to follow:

          <h3>Outdoor Precautions</h3>
          <div class="outdoor_box">
            <h4>1. Check Air Quality Regularly</h4>
            <img src="../assets/prevention_1.jpeg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Monitor the air quality index (AQI) in your area. Our app give
              real-time information about the indoor air quality, helping you to
              plan your day ahead. Strictly refrain from any outdoor activities
              when the AQI reaches above 300.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="outdoor_box">
            <h4>2. Wear an N95 or N99 mask</h4>
            <img src="../assets/n95mask.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Surgical masks or cloth masks may not be enough to filter out
              harmful pollutants. Consider investing in an N95 or N99 mask,
              which is capable of filtering out particulate matter (PM2.5) and
              other harmful pollutants. Dispose of the mask responsibly after
              use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="outdoor_box">
            <h4>3. Limit Outdoor Activities</h4>
            <img src="../assets/ban_outside.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              During peak pollution times, it’s best to avoid outdoor exercises
              like running, jogging, or cycling, which will increase the oxygen
              requirement of the body. Inhaling polluted air can cause
              irritation in the airways. Try to limit outdoor activities and do
              mild exercises at home.
            </p>

          <div class="outdoor_box">
            <h4>4. Opt for Public Transport or Carpooling</h4>
            <img src="../assets/car_pooling.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Reducing your own contribution to air pollution is equally
              important. One of the simplest ways is to drive less. Use public
              transportation, carpool, or, better yet, switch to cycling or
              walking for short distances. Not only does this cut down on
              vehicle emissions, but it also helps reduce congestion, another
              contributor to urban air woes. Plus, it’s lighter on your wallet!

          <h3>Indoor Precautions</h3>
          <div class="indoor_box">
            <h4>1. Use an air purifier for indoor at office or home</h4>
            <img src="../assets/indoor_purifier.jfif" alt="" />
            <p>
              Contrary to popular belief, indoor air isn’t always cleaner than
              outdoor air. Dust, cooking fumes, and even furniture can
              contribute to indoor pollution. Investing in a good air purifier,
              particularly one with a HEPA filter, can significantly improve air
              quality in your home. Place purifiers in rooms where you spend the
              most time—like the bedroom or living room. If you can’t afford
              multiple units, focus on creating a “clean zone” in one part of
              your house.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="indoor_box">
            <h4>2. Boost Your Diet</h4>
            <img src="../assets/healthy_eating.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Consume vitamin C-rich fruits, magnesium-rich meals, and
              omega-rich foods. By maintaining your immunity, a balanced diet
              can help you combat the negative consequences of pollution.
              Vitamins A, C, and E aid in the healing of the body and the
              prevention of inflammation caused by pollution or other toxins.
              Nutritionists recommend eating carrots, sweet potatoes, radish,
              spinach, fenugreek (methi), and pumpkin for Vitamin A, based on
              the vegetables and fruits available this season. Vitamin C is
              abundant in lemon, Amla, and oranges, whereas Vitamin E is
              abundant in rice bran oil and almonds.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="indoor_box">
            <h4>3. Use indoor Green plants</h4>
            <img src="../assets/indoor_air_quality.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              indoor green plants like snake plants and peace lilies can
              slightly improve air quality by absorbing toxins like
              formaldehyde, their impact is often exaggerated. Research shows
              you'd need hundreds of plants to match the effectiveness of a
              single air purifier. However, plants do offer psychological
              benefits and can complement other air-cleaning methods when used
              in moderation. For real air quality improvement, focus on proper
              ventilation, HEPA filters, and reducing pollution sources first.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="indoor_box">
            <h4>4. Ventilation</h4>
            <img src="../assets/ventilation.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Proper ventilation is crucial for maintaining healthy indoor air
              quality (AQI) as it helps dilute and remove pollutants like CO₂,
              VOCs, and particulate matter. Opening windows for 10-15 minutes
              daily (when outdoor AQI is good) flushes out stale air and brings
              in fresh oxygen. Use exhaust fans in kitchens/bathrooms to expel
              moisture and cooking fumes, which can spike PM2.5 levels. For
              spaces with poor airflow, cross-ventilation (opposite windows) or
              smart air purifiers with outdoor air filters can balance freshness
              without compromising filtration.
