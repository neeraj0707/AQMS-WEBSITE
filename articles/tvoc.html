      <h4>What is TVOC ?</h4>
      <p>
        TVOC refers to Total Volatile Organic Compounds, which is one of the air
        quality detection standards, mainly including benzene, alkanes, aromatic
        hydrocarbons, alkenes, halogenated hydrocarbons, esters, aldehydes,
        ketones and others. Organic matter with a saturated vapor pressure
        exceeding 133.32pa at room temperature and a boiling point between 50℃
        and 250℃ will exist in the air in the form of evaporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        TVOC is not a single gas, because its components are hydrocarbons,
        halogenated hydrocarbons, oxygen hydrocarbons and nitrogen hydrocarbons,
        including: benzene series, organic chlorides, freon series, organic
        ketones, amines, alcohols, ethers, esters, acids and petroleum
        compounds. It is a variety of volatile organic compounds.
      </p>

      <h4>Where does TVOC come from?</h4>
      <p>
        TVOC comes from a variety of sources, including building materials,
        decorative materials, daily necessities and office supplies. For
        example, artificial boards, foam insulation materials, plastic sheets,
        paints, coatings, adhesives, wallpapers, carpets, cosmetics and
        detergents may release total volatile organic compounds. In addition,
        household fuels, smoking, human excrement, outdoor industrial waste gas,
        automobile exhaust, etc. are also sources of TVOC.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concentration of indoor TVOC is usually between 0.2mg/m³ and 2mg/m³.
        However, this value may be dozens of times higher when the decoration is
        improper. The main components of TVOC are benzene and chlorinated
        hydrocarbons, which mainly come from indoor decoration materials such as
        paint, wallpaper, putty and adhesive. TVOC produced by indoor decoration
        will damage human health, and its pollution effect lasts for a long time
        and is not easy to reduce over time.
