      <h3>What is particulate matter?</h3>
      <p>
        Particulate Matter (PM) is a critical component measured in the Air
        Quality Index (AQI), representing tiny airborne particles that pose
        serious health risks. PM is categorized by size, with PM2.5 (fine
        particles ≤2.5 microns) and PM10 (coarse particles ≤10 microns) being
        the most monitored.
      </p>
      <p>
        These particles originate from vehicle emissions, industrial activities,
        construction dust, wildfires, and even household sources like cooking
        smoke. When AQI levels rise due to high PM concentrations, the air
        becomes hazardous—especially PM2.5, which can penetrate deep into lungs
        and bloodstream, worsening asthma, heart disease, and even causing
        premature death. Governments and health agencies use AQI’s PM data to
        issue public warnings, recommending masks (like N95s) and reduced
        outdoor activity when levels exceed safe limits. Reducing PM pollution
        remains a key focus in global efforts to improve air quality and public
        health
      </p>

      <div class="PM_types">
        <p>
          Here's the types of particulate matter (PM) measured in air quality
          index (AQI) systems
        </p>

        <ul class="PM_list">
          <li>PM10 (coarse)</li>
          <li>PM2.5 (fine)</li>
          <li>PM1 (very fine)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Current air pollution regulations worldwide focus on PM2.5 and PM10,
          yet the potentially more dangerous ultrafine particles escape
          oversight as scientists work to understand their impacts and develop
          measurement tools
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="PM_causes">
        <p>
          Particulate Matter (PM) originates from both natural and human-made
          sources. These tiny particles are released into the air through
          various processes and can have harmful effects on health and the
          environment.

        <h4>Natural Sources of PM</h4>
        <ul class="PM_sources">
          <li>Dust Storms</li>
          <li>Wildfires</li>
          <li>Volcanic Eruption</li>
          <li>Sea Spray</li>
          <li>Mollen and Mold Spores</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Human-Made Sources of PM</h4>
        <ul class="PM_sources">
          <li>Vehicle Emissions</li>
          <li>Industrial Processes</li>

        <h4>What are the health effects of particulate matter?</h4>
        <p>
          Exposure to particulate matter (PM), especially fine PM₂.₅ and
          ultrafine particles, poses severe health risks by penetrating deep
          into the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. When inhaled, these
          microscopic particles bypass the body's natural defenses, embedding in
          lung tissue or entering the bloodstream. Short-term exposure can
          trigger asthma attacks, bronchitis, and irregular heart rhythms, while
          long-term exposure is linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
          (COPD), lung cancer, heart disease, and strokes.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Vulnerable groups—children, the elderly, and those with preexisting
          conditions—face higher risks, including developmental delays in kids
          and premature death in adults. Emerging research also suggests PM may
          contribute to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and
          diabetes. The World Health Organization attributes 7 million annual
          deaths to air pollution, with PM as a leading factor. Even low-level
          exposure over time reduces life expectancy, making PM one of the most
          pervasive environmental health threats globally. Protective measures
          like monitoring AQI levels, wearing N95 masks in polluted areas, and
          using HEPA air filters can help mitigate these dangers.
